I am a JavaScript developer turned engineering manager located close to Karlsruhe, Germany. I am currently working at [GoTo](https://goto.com), managing a distributed team.

On this blog I write about what I learn.

I am [@kahliltweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/kahliltweets) on Twitter but the best way to reach me is by sending an email to [kahlil@hey.com](mailto:kahlil@hey.com).

You can find all my open source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/kahlil).
