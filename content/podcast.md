**Update from 2020-05-19:**  
The podcast below has been discontinued. We just got too busy and our schedules were not combinable anymore. 

I am working on some other stuff. Stay tuned.

Every week I record an episode of the [Reactive podcast](http://reactive.audio) with my friend
[Henning Glatter-GÃ¶tz](https://twitter.com/hglattergotz). We talk about tech, culture, web development and things we
learned or noticed over the last week.

You can subscribe to it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/reactive/id1020286000?l=en&mt=2">on iTunes</a> or
your favorite podcast app. And if you like it we'd be thrilled if you'd leave a review.
