Every week I record an episode of the [Reactive podcast](http://reactive.audio) with
my friends [Raquel Vélez](https://twitter.com/rockbot) and [Henning Glatter-Götz](https://twitter.com/hglattergotz). We talk about tech, culture, web development and things we learned or noticed over the last week.

You can subscribe to it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/reactive/id1020286000?l=en&mt=2">on iTunes</a> or your favorite podcast app. And if you like it we'd be thrilled if you'd leave a review.
